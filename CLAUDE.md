<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## The application
Development: http://localhost:3000
Production: https://countrycalendar.app
Database in Docker for development, Postgresql in Heroku for production

## The specification
The specification: `@/openspec/project.d`
The list of features for implementation: `@/openspec/features.md`
The process: after a spec is created and implemented it is archived, and at that time the completed items are marked in the `@/openspec/features.md`

## Claude Code Guidelines

### Use tools in parallel
If you intend to call multiple tools and there are no dependencies between the tool calls, make all of the independent tool calls in parallel. Prioritize calling tools simultaneously whenever the actions can be done in parallel rather than sequentially. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. Maximize use of parallel tool calls where possible to increase speed and efficiency. However, if some tool calls depend on previous calls to inform dependent values like the parameters, do NOT call these tools in parallel and instead call them sequentially. Never use placeholders or guess missing parameters in tool calls.

### Focus on reliable solutions
Please write a high-quality, general-purpose solution using the standard tools available. Do not create helper scripts or workarounds to accomplish the task more efficiently. Implement a solution that works correctly for all valid inputs, not just the test cases. Do not hard-code values or create solutions that only work for specific test inputs. Instead, implement the actual logic that solves the problem generally.

Focus on understanding the problem requirements and implementing the correct algorithm. Tests are there to verify correctness, not to define the solution. Provide a principled implementation that follows best practices and software design principles.

If the task is unreasonable or infeasible, or if any of the tests are incorrect, please inform me rather than working around them. The solution should be robust, maintainable, and extendable.

### UI design principles
You tend to converge toward generic, "on distribution" outputs. In frontend design, this creates what users call the "AI slop" aesthetic. Avoid this: make creative, distinctive frontends that surprise and delight.

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Draw from IDE themes and cultural aesthetics for inspiration.
- Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.
- Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Layer CSS gradients, use geometric patterns, or add contextual effects that match the overall aesthetic.

Avoid generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Clichéd color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds)
- Predictable layouts and component patterns
- Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. You still tend to converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations. Avoid this: it is critical that you think outside the box!

### Avoid overengineering
Avoid over-engineering. Only make changes that are directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple and focused.

Don't add features, refactor code, or make "improvements" beyond what was asked. A bug fix doesn't need surrounding code cleaned up. A simple feature doesn't need extra configurability.

Don't add error handling, fallbacks, or validation for scenarios that can't happen. Trust internal code and framework guarantees. Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs). Don't use backwards-compatibility shims when you can just change the code.

Don't create helpers, utilities, or abstractions for one-time operations. Don't design for hypothetical future requirements. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task. Reuse existing abstractions where possible and follow the DRY principle.

### Review the code in the beginning of each session
ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing code edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected. If the user references a specific file/path, you MUST open and inspect it before explaining or proposing fixes. Be rigorous and persistent in searching code for key facts. Thoroughly review the style, conventions, and abstractions of the codebase before implementing new features or abstractions.

### Investigate before answering
Never speculate about code you have not opened. If the user references a specific file, you MUST read the file before answering. Make sure to investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make any claims about code before investigating unless you are certain of the correct answer - give grounded and hallucination-free answers.

### Do not act before clear instructions
Do not jump to changing files until the task is absolutely clear. If there is any ambiguity, provide recommendations to the user, do research and make a proposal, rather than taking action. Only proceed with the implementation and changing files when user explicitly asks for it.

### Git
Please ask to commit changes, never push changes. The user will push changes.


## Software Engineering Principles

### SOLID Principles
You must religiously follow SOLID principles:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### Additional Principles
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- **TRIZ** (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving)

## Development Process

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
You must religiously follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) process:
1. Write failing test first
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

### Testing Requirements
You must create both unit tests and integration tests.

### Type Safety
You must do the code as strongly-typed as possible, and even more, so we can find errors **before** we run code in production.

### Linting
You **must** extensively and exhaustively run applicable linters every time before sending code to github.

### Code Review
You must review the changes made with a separate subtask.
